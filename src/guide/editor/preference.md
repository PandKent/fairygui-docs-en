Here you can assign new hotkeys for frequently used functions. The hotkeys of "Copy / Paste / Cut / Select All / Unselect All / Undo / Redo" cannot be modified. Other functions can be modified by clicking the hotkey link.

The editor does not distinguish between the Ctrl and Command keys, they are equivalent.
