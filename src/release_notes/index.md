## 2020.1.1
1. Add ThreeJS project typeã€‚[Source](https://github.com/fairygui/FairyGUI-threejs) [Guide](https://github.com/fairygui/FairyGUI-threejs-example)

## 2020.1.0
1. In this version, we have made a comprehensive reconstruction of the editor, replacing the underlying adobe AIR runtime of the original editor with Unity.
2. Added a new component type: 3D content loader. Different from the ordinary loader which can only load pictures and sequence frame animation, it is used to load more complex contents in 3D engine, such as skeleton animation, model, particles, etc. At present, the support of skeleton animation has been completed. Drag the skeleton animation directly into the editor.
3. The editor now supports importing font files. You can directly import font files with suffix TTF / TTC / OTF into the editor.
4. Support using SDF technology to render fonts (i.e. textmeshpro in unity).
5. The plug-in mechanism has been upgraded. Starting with the 2020 version, we use Lua as the development language for plug-ins. At the same time, AS3 is no longer supported to develop plug-ins.
6. Add the switch of color space, namely gamma color space and linear color space.
7. Now the resource library can display thumbnails of pictures.
8. Two tools have been added: "find unused resources" and "find duplicate resources".
9. Optimize the way of command line release and execution.
10. Added a rolling container setting, you can set "edge" do not crop.
11. A publishing setting is added. When the publishing method of "trunk contains all branches" is selected, you can choose whether to publish the pictures of branches to a separate texture set.
